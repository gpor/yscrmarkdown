<h2>Healthcare Worker Cultural Safety Working Group</h2>
<div><p>Cultural safety in Australian workplaces, particularly within the healthcare sector, remains a significant challenge. According to the Medical Training Survey, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander trainees are more likely to experience bullying, harassment, discrimination and/or racism at work than the national average. This data has spurred the need for comprehensive cultural safety programs, which are critical to ensuring a respectful and supportive workplace for all employees. <br></p></div>
