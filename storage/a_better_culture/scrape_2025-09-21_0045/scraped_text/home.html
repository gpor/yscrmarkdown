<span>The how</span> Engagement Structure </h2></div>
<div><p>The project is governed by two main bodies; the RACMA board that is responsible for corporate governance and the Advisory Board responsible for content governance. The Advisory Board comprises representation from Colleges, peak health bodies, and subject matter experts in workplace culture, discrimination and harassment. The project also has 12 reference groups and 5 working groups. The reference groups act as vital consultation bodies, offering grassroots-level information to support the working groups and project team. Currently we have 12 reference groups with 151 members across all. The Working Groups supports the Advisory Board via the provision of content expertise and implementation support across the system</p></div>
